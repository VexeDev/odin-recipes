    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ground beef</li>
        <li>Mini burger buns</li>
        <li>Cheese slices (e.g., cheddar or American) </li>
        <li>Lettuce</li> 
        <li>Tomato</li> 
        <li>Pickles</li> 
        <li>Ketchup</li> 
        <li>Mustard</li>
        <li>Mayonnaise</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Black pepper</li>
        <li>Butter (for toasting buns)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your grill or skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Form the ground beef into small, palm-sized patties, slightly larger than the buns. Season each patty with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Place the patties on the grill or skillet, cooking for about 2-3 minutes on each side for medium doneness, or until they reach your preferred level of cooking.</li>
        <li>A minute before the patties are done, top each with a slice of cheese to melt.</li>
        <li>While the patties cook, split the mini buns in half and lightly butter the cut sides. Toast the buns on the grill or in a separate skillet until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Prepare the toppings by washing and drying the lettuce, slicing the tomato into thin rounds, and cutting the pickles if needed.</li>
        <li>Assemble the sliders by spreading ketchup, mustard, and mayonnaise on the bottom half of the toasted buns, followed by a lettuce leaf, a tomato slice, and a pickle.</li>
        <li>Place a cheese-topped beef patty on each prepared bun bottom, then cap with the top half of the buns.</li>
        <li>Serve the mini sliders immediately while they're warm and the cheese is still gooey. Enjoy!</li>
