    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Baguette or ciabatta bread</li>
        <li>Ripe tomatoes</li>
        <li>Fresh basil leaves</li>
        <li>Garlic cloves</li>
        <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>Balsamic glaze or vinegar</li>
        <li>Sea salt</li>
        <li>Black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>1. Preheat your oven to a moderate temperature for toasting the bread.</li>
        <li>2. Slice the baguette or ciabatta into 1/2-inch thick pieces, on a diagonal to increase surface area.</li>
        <li>3. Peel and halve the garlic cloves, and set them aside.</li>
        <li>4. Place the bread slices on a baking sheet and toast in the oven until they are golden and crisp, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
        <li>5. While the bread is toasting, dice the tomatoes and place them in a mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>6. Tear or chop the fresh basil leaves and add them to the tomatoes.</li>
        <li>7. Drizzle the tomato and basil mixture with extra virgin olive oil, add a splash of balsamic glaze or vinegar, and season with sea salt and black pepper to taste. Gently toss to combine.</li>
        <li>8. Once the bread is toasted, remove from the oven and while still warm, rub one side of each slice with the cut side of the garlic cloves for a hint of flavor.</li>
        <li>9. Top each garlic-rubbed bread slice with a generous spoonful of the tomato mixture.</li>
        <li>10. Drizzle with a little more extra virgin olive oil and balsamic glaze if desired, and serve immediately to enjoy the contrast of warm, crispy bread with the cool, refreshing topping.</li>
    </ol>
